# Blinkit_Data_Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on a dataset from Blinkit, a quick-commerce service. The project uses Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore key business questions, analyze sales trends, and visualize insights.

## Project Description
The BDA.ipynb notebook walks through the entire data analysis process, from data loading and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights into factors affecting sales and outlet performance.

## Key Analyses Performed
Data Exploration: Understanding the structure, types, and summary statistics of the dataset.

### Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

### Sales Analysis:

### Total sales by item.

### Sales distribution by outlet location type.

### Sales distribution by outlet size.

### Item-Level Insights: Analyzing the relationship between item fat content, visibility, and sales.

### Data Visualization: Using bar plots and other visualizations to present findings clearly.

Files
BDA.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, markdown explanations, and visualizations.

Blinkit Dataset The raw dataset used for this analysis. Please ensure this file is present in the same directory as the notebook. (Note: The dataset file name was not specified in the notebook, so you may need to update this line.)

### Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

**pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn**

How to Run
Make sure you have all the required libraries installed.

Place the dataset file in the same directory as the BDA.ipynb notebook.

Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (such as JupyterLab or VS Code with the Jupyter extension).

Run the cells in sequence to see the analysis and reproduce the results.
